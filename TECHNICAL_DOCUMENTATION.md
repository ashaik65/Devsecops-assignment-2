# 🛡️ GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS) Integration – Technical Documentation

## 📌 1. Context – Why Are We Doing This?

Security is a foundational requirement for modern software development. As part of a DevSecOps strategy, enabling **GitHub Advanced Security (GHAS)** helps to identify and mitigate security vulnerabilities **early in the development lifecycle**.

This POC demonstrates integrating GHAS into a vulnerable sample Python project ([damn-vulnerable-MCP-server](https://github.com/vulnerable-apps/damn-vulnerable-MCP-server)) with the following security goals:
- **Code Scanning** using GitHub’s CodeQL
- **Dependency Scanning** with Dependabot
- **Secret Detection** (e.g., AWS credentials)
- Centralized visibility through **Security Alerts**

---

## 🔬 2. Thought Process (POC Details)

### 🔧 Tooling Selected:
- **CodeQL**: Static code analysis engine that automatically finds vulnerabilities in Python code.
- **Dependabot**: Dependency graph scanner that detects vulnerable versions in `requirements.txt` and Docker images.
- **GitHub Secret Scanning**: Flags hardcoded credentials like AWS access keys, passwords, tokens.

### 🧪 Repository Setup:
- Created GitHub repository.
- Pushed intentionally vulnerable Python app (`damn-vulnerable-MCP-server`).
- Added `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` for automatic code scanning.
- Added `.github/dependabot.yml` to scan:
  - Python packages via `pip` (daily)
  - Docker base image (daily)

### 🪪 Secret Detection Tested:
- Pushed an AWS Access Key ID + Secret Key in a test commit.
- GitHub immediately blocked the push and triggered a **secret alert**, proving secret detection was working.

### 📷 Screenshots Attached:
1. **Dependabot alerts showing CVEs**

## 📊 3. Impact Analysis (Benefits and Considerations)

### ✅ Benefits:
- **Shift-Left Security**: Vulnerabilities found at commit/PR stage, not in production.
- **Reduced Risk**: Early secret and CVE detection prevents credential leaks and supply chain attacks.
- **Low Overhead**: No additional agents or CI cost. Native to GitHub Actions.
- **Automation**: Scans run on schedule and on pull requests.

### ⚠️ Tradeoffs:
- **Slight CI/CD Overhead**: CodeQL scans add ~30–60 seconds to CI jobs.
- **False Positives**: Some security warnings may not apply or be critical, requiring manual triage.
- **Public Key Leaks**: Even pushing a test AWS key triggers alerts and blocks, so test keys must be carefully crafted or excluded.

---

## ✅ 4. Conclusion

Once GHAS was enabled and the pipeline set up:
- GitHub **automatically scanned the Python code and Dockerfile**.
- **CodeQL** detected several hardcoded strings and insecure patterns.
- **Dependabot** reported multiple vulnerable packages in `requirements.txt`, e.g., old versions of `Flask`, `Jinja2`.
- **Secret scanning** flagged AWS credentials during a test push (blocked automatically).

This integration showcases the **power of GHAS to enforce security hygiene** in real-time without external tools. Vulnerabilities were visualized, tracked, and actionable recommendations were provided—all from within the GitHub UI.
